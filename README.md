# LicenSePlate_Yolov8_FilterSVM_PaddleOCR
Project that uses Yolov8 as license plate detector, followed by a filter whose code is obtained by applying a filter code to each of the filters considered in the reference project https://github.com/ablanco1950/LicensePlate_Yolov8_Filters_PaddleOCR, with which you can recognize that board by paddleOCR and setting an SVM prediction
